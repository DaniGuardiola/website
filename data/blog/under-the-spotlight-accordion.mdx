An accordion component is a list of clickable headings that reveal a section of content.

On the surface, building an accordion from scratch seems straight-forward. But there are many cases to consider. Such as accessibility concerns, keyboard navigation, animation of dynamic section heights and the ability to expand only one or multiple at a time.

The Radix accordion has been carefully built to ensure you, and your users, have the best possible experience.

## A closer look

Our goal is to ensure the accordion component adheres to the [WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#accordion) while providing the best possible developer and user experiences.

This is the most common example of an Accordion component. By default, all sections are collpased. You can click on a heading to exapand its content. If you click on a different heading,

Below is a list of all the features we've built into our Accordion, they all work out of the box.

### Open multiple

The Radix Accordion allows you to have multiple sections revealed at once.

<AccordionDemo type="multiple" initialValue={['item-2', 'item-3']} />

### Extendable

Built with extensibility in mind, you have full control over its aesthethics. For example, you could add chevrons to further illustrate the headers.

<AccordionDemo showChevrons />
